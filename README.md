The code stored here is used to execute the masters dissertation project of the student Augusto Berndt from the program PGMICRO, in university UFRGS from 2018 to 2020.

This software is able to optmize the size of neural networks represented in the And-Inverter Graph format with approximate computing. The simplification is done by calculating the signal probability of internal AND nodes based on the trainig set and defining some nodes as constants.
