#Neural Network Otpmizer Through Approximate Computing
This software is able to optmize the size of neural networks already represented in the And-Inverter Graph format, the optmization is applied with an approximate computing strategy. The simplification is done by calculating the signal probability of internal AND nodes based on the trainig set and defining some nodes as constants.

This project is related to a masters dissertation project of the student Augusto Berndt from the program PGMICRO in UFRGS from 2018 to 2020 (software implementation from 2019 to 2020).
